# canes-rankings

This is sample react project. The end goal is to rebuild https://section328.com/all-time-carolina-hurricanes-rankings/ in a react app.

[Current Progress](https://section328rankings.netlify.com/)

Here is the process involved with the project to date:

## Completed

- [x] Create new empty repository \[[Link](https://github.com/PatClarke27/canes-rankings/commit/6315b2e69d70409efc4a827b0c003a583e83363c)\]
- [x] Install ParcelJS and get it to run a static website showing just a text \[[Link](https://github.com/PatClarke27/canes-rankings/commit/dd0c4d434025997e2e84b8e2484fb575342c695d)\]
- [x] Add React to that website \[[Link](https://github.com/PatClarke27/canes-rankings/commit/88cec654c82e9b95e0ddf1d1bebf092424071b7c)\]
- [x] Try and show a list of players that you statically define inside your component.

## To-Do

- [ ] Create a basic `App` component as entry to your application, move the rankings to a separate file.
- [ ] You now have full static content in the render of your rankings class, could you change that so the component receives an array that it will display?
- [ ] Once you have done that, try and take a look if the code should be split up even more.
- [ ] You could also think about how you want to show the full information of the player, should that be a popup, a modal, or should the table extend to make room for the information, so that we can start working on that next.
- [ ] Should you run out of work and want to go on, you can try and add a click event to the rows and for example highlight to row, or show the ID in a popup, depending on what you decide in the previous point.
